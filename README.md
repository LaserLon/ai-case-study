`print("Hello, World!")`

## Overview and Origin

### Overview 

TabNine is a company focused on *AI-powered code completion*.

### Origins

Codota was established in 2013 by Dror Weiss and Professor Eran Yahav in Tel Aviv, Israel. TabNine was founded by Jacob Jackson in 2015. Codota acquired TabNine in late 2019 and rebranded as TabNine in 2021. This aquisition significantly increased the company's AI capabilities as well as expand market reach and user base.

## Business Activities

### Problem
TabNine is designed to significantly enhance developer productivity and improve code quality by streamlining the coding process with AI-powered tools. AI tools like TabNine are changing how developers interact with their code, making coding more about strategic problem-solving and less about remembering syntax and routine code.

### Customers
TabNine serves a diverse range of customers, including individual developers, software companies, and educational institutions that teach coding. Currently, TabNine has over 1 million users with its software installed on more than 10 million integrated development environments (IDEs), generating over 4 million lines of code daily.

### TabNine Advantage
TabNine offers several unique benefits that differentiate it from competitors:
- **Best-in-class AI Code Generation**: Streamlines code generation and automates routine tasks, significantly reducing development time.
- **AI-Powered Chat Support**: Enhances the entire software development lifecycle with AI-driven insights and suggestions.
- **Personalized AI Assistance**: Provides context-aware coding support, tailored to individual developers and team projects.
- **Commitment to Code Privacy and Integrity**: Ensures total code confidentiality with zero data retention policies.
- **Intellectual Property Protection**: Relies exclusively on models trained on permissively licensed sources to mitigate IP risks.


### Technology
TabNine utilizes Large Language Models ([LLMs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/large-language-model-llm/)) trained exclusively on permissively licensed code, ensuring a high level of protection against the risks and liabilities associated with the use of unlicensed intellectual property.

## Landscape

### The Field

TabNine operates in the field of software development providing developer tools that specifically focusing on artificial intelligence-driven code development assistants. TabNine AI in code completion uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to provide solutions to common coding challenges, enabling more efficient and accurate software development by predicting and suggesting relevant code snippets in real time.

### Trends

Deep learning models like transformers have been a game changer for code completion tools. These models can understand the context of code much better than previous technologies. Code suggestions are becoming more accurate and relevant. Integration directly into IDEs improves workflow efficiency as developers do not need to switch away from their IDE to benefit from AI assistance. 

### Competition

TabNine has several competitors that have similar products. Here are a few to consider: 
1. [Pieces for Developers](https://code.pieces.app/)
2. [Otter.ai](https://otter.ai/)
3. [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/index/openai-codex/)
4. [Amazon CodeWhisperer](https://aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/)
5. [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)




## Results

### Impact 
AI powered code generation tools have had a significant impact on software coding. Developers benefit greatly from the assistance of generating code. As a developer, I am still the architect that designs the coded solution. Code generation tools help me to not get bogged down in the minutiae of code developement. 

Code generation tools increase productivity, improve code quality, enhance learning and encourage modern development practices. 

### Metrics
The success of the code development assistance can be judged by the number of subscribers to the provided service. 

Otter.ai: 14,000,000
TabNine: 1,000,000 +
GitHub Copilot: 400,000 
Pieces for Developers: 15,000

## Recommendations

### Enhancements
To further enhance its market position, I would reccomend that TabNine include additional and more obscure programming languages. For example, having an assistant that supports the IEC-61131-3 standard would be beneficial to programable logic controller (PLC) developers. 

Additionally, introducing a service that would transform one programming language into another would be beneficial. If I am proficient in python but need an application written in C#, a tool that performed that conversion would be amazing. 

Another innovative idea would be to have code assistant for applications like excel and similar applications. OFten times I know what I need to do but not always how to do it. An assistant for excel development would be incredibly helpful. 

These enhancements would not require additional technologies to develop. I believe they could use the same LLMs that power the currently provided services.
